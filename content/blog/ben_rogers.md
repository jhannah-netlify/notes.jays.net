I don't remember buying this album. It was playing on rotation and the lyrics grabbed me.

Stunned I couldn't find the lyrics anywhere, I transcribed them myself below.

"Sinners" from album "The Bloodred Yonder" (2015)

Somebody just called me a fag  
For picking flowers from a chainlink fence   
On jetlagged widows and jigsaw women  
I spent my father's inheritance

Now the Bible read [?] them all on the corner  
He holds a cardboard sign  
It reads "I can accept failure, and cash credit, or check"  
I laugh and I toss him a dime

Well, God spoke to me last night  
I told him I don't talk to strangers  
The guardian angel of death  
Watches over the sinners

Now the spit valve serenades on Wall Street  
The trumpets like the drone of flies  
Well fruit has its seasons  
It rots and it dies  
But the whiskey is always right

And if I had a dollar for every time  
You said you loved me, well I'd still be poor  
But I'd give every penny in my pocket tonight  
To hear you say you love me once more

One shot to steady the nerves  
And twelve more to kill them

The guardian angel of death  
Watches over of the sinners

The guardian angel of death  
Watches over of the sinners
