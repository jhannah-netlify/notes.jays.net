I've been super into podcasts since before iTunes knew they were a thing.
Big fan. I consume more hours of podcasts than any other form of media.

I love [Mastodon](/blog/mastodon/), and was very enticed by "podcasting
2.0!" It's your podcast, *on the Fediverse!* Oooo! Sold!
So I also publish [my podcast](/blog/jay_flaunts/) on a hosted Castopod
server.

So what's the problem?

Well, for me, the point of being on the Fediverse is full interactions with
others on the Fediverse. I'm Mastodon-centric, so I want full interactions
with Mastodon.

A year ago, as far as I could tell, Castopod <-> Mastodon interactions
were mostly broken.

I'm pleased to report Castopod is *almost* doing what I want now?

Assuming your Castopod server is up to date, you now have
a notification landing page where you can see:

* @foo started following you
* @foo shared your post
* @foo replied to your post

You can click on those notifications and there's a Reply button! Score!

But when you use that Reply button, the person you reply to doesn't receive
a notification on their side.

Oh. Maybe this is just because they've got a trivial bug where they forgot
to stick @foo in the front of the message in their UI?

Oh. Nope. Even if you go out of your way to "@foo hey! thanks! glad you liked
that episode" as your reply, they still don't receive a notification on their
side. It does that weird 

```
@foo@example.com [example.com] hey! thanks!...
```

thing on their side. So they're probably never going to know your podcast
replied to them. Ugh.

(That visual brokenness seems to happen a lot when I try to take the Fediverse
seriously.)

Maybe Castopod is getting super close to being what I want?

If only their hosted server offering (podcast.audio) wasn't insanely slow /
down fairly often on the rare occasions I try to use it?

So close to being so awesome??
