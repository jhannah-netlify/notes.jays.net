âœ… Thursday evening: collect eggs. I also scooped lots of snow off the top, which
I figured was better than not doing that. Looks like the electric is OK, though it is
very snowy there, so I might feel better if it was elevated under a bucket or something.
I have buckets, bricks, if you want me to do that. 7 chickens look and sound healthy and
happy.

[ ] Friday morning: feed half of spinach, cup of black oil sunflower seeds, cup of mealworms; fill water. (For breakfast, there will be a green bin hanging from the chicken run entrance door that you can use.)

[ ] Saturday morning: feed remaining half of spinach, cup of black oil sunflower seeds, cup of mealworms, fill water, hang full feeder, and put near empty feeder in gray bin on side of house. (For breakfast, there will be a green bin hanging from the chicken run entrance door that you can use.)
