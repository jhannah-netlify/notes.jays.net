âœ… Thursday evening: collect eggs. I also scooped lots of snow off the top, which
I figured was better than not doing that. Looks like the electric is OK, though it is
very snowy there, so I might feel better if it was elevated under a bucket or something.
I have buckets, bricks, if you want me to do that. 7 chickens look and sound healthy and
happy.

âœ… Friday morning: feed half of spinach, cup of black oil sunflower seeds, cup of mealworms; fill water. (For breakfast, there will be a green bin hanging from the chicken run entrance door that you can use.)

* Chickens very noisy in the mornings. ðŸ™‚
* "cup of mealworms" -- the mealworms had a 1/2 cup measuring cup inside, so I interpreted that to mean two of those 1/2 cups.
* "cup of sunflower" -- big blue cup in the sunflower seeds, so I interpreted that to mean
a full blue cup (which is 4-5 [measuring cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_cup)?).
I figured it was safer to over than underfeed them.
* I threw the spinach in, spreading it around -- they were immediately, mildly interested.
* The rest of the food went into the green bin, which I hung inside and they were very
aggressively pushing each other around. That seemed bad, so I scooped 1/3 of it out into my hand and tossed it around inside to spread it out so they weren't all fighting at the green
thing.
* Only 6 chickens were eating, the 7th was nesting. There was already 1 egg in the middle
nest box. I left the non-eating chicken and the egg alone.
* The green water was still full, so I didn't do any water stuff. Looked pretty clean.
