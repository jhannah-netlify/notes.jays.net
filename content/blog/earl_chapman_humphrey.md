Via scuba diving, I collected things about my grandfather [here](https://usshoustondive.com/divers/jay_hannah/).

Via genealogy, I collected things about my grandfather [here](http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I1581.html).

On Earl's birthday (he would have turned 106 today) Mom asked me to tell her a story
about grandpa. Some candidates:

Some memories of the farm in SE Iowa:
* Playing croquet in the yard, hammering those wooden balls through the stakes.
  The big trees, the walnut tree.
* The water well. The huge concrete lid. (That puts water in the house? How?)
* The old grape vines down the yard.
* Chopping a Christmas tree and hauling it back and setting it up.
* Exploring the old barns. The old hay. The old big tractors.
* The old clothes line. The close fencing. The tall corn.
* Cats, kittens everywhere.
* Endless trips to the close pond.
* "Big" trips to the far pond.
* Fireflies.
* Frogs and countless bugs everywhere.
* Wading the creek (grandpa barefoot). Looking for turtles. I don't think we found one?
* Plinking milk jugs full of water on the old fences with the 22 rifle.
* Driving "into town" in the newer car or the old pickup.
* Rides on the lawn mower.
* "Look at this caterpillar."
* Infinite stacks of National Geographic.
* The old globe. The old coffee grinder. The clock grandpa made.
* The fancy doilies on the tables.
* Dad and grandpa word working in the basement. Endless discussions of the best
  natural varnishes.
* Farm dogs. "Stupid" chasing cars. Others?
* The old rotating antennae on the roof. The controller making a click click click
  sound as the motor tried to point at the best tower for that TV channel.
  "For channel 6 you have to point towards Burlington, which is east."
  Some list like that. Magic.
* "Teaching me how to drive" the old pickup. The old tractor.
* The photo of grandpa standing on his war ship. "Which one is you?" "I don't know."
* Hundreds of old tools on the walls of the garage.
