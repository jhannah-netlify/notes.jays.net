Apparently, from 2011-2025 I purchased 291 books+ from the Kindle store.

I love/d the convenience of my Kindles.
Traveling all over the world, or not, it was miraculous that I could buy
books from anywhere and read them immediately, in such a tiny portable device.

The authors get the vast majority of the money(?), Amazon keeps a reasonable cut for the tech,
I can grow my library forever and move it in the palm of my hand. Amazing.

Then I started reading that some authors were pissed off about Amazon keeping
most, or nearly all, of the money.
[So they stopped selling there](https://mwl.io/faq).

While some authors are, apparently, [Audible/Amazon exclusive](http://dennisetaylor.org/wheres-the-whatever-version/).

(Meanwhile, Amazon destroyed most physical book stores nationwide, apparently.
Zine: [How To Resist Amazon and Why](https://www.ravenbookstore.com/product/how-resist-amazon-and-why).
I'm not into physical books, so I still don't pay much attention to that, other
than generally supporting anti-trust enforcement. We used to do that. üá∫üá∏)

## Humble Bundle fiasco: 2024

Jan 25 2024. Recapping a few hours of frustrating labor you should avoid:

I paid+donated $100 total to Humble Bundle + Harper Collins + a charity for a collection
of Terry Pratchett eBooks.

I'm on macOS. To read them I had to:
* Install Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) üëé and [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) üëç.
* Install [DeDRM](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools) üëç plugin for Calibre.
(All of that can be done via the UIs, no need to drop to command line stuff for any of this.)
* With all of those installed, I then had to click in Kobo.com, one book at a time, to "download each book" into Adobe Digital Editions.
* Then in Calibre, you can bulk add all those books into Calibre from `~/Documents/Digital Editions/`.
* Then in Calibre, you can bulk "Save to disk in a single folder" out to disk.

Now you can actually read the `.epub` books you bought in whatever eBook reader you want.

**BUT DON'T DO THAT**. What a waste of time. Instead:

The [archive.org versions](https://archive.org/details/discworld-complete-43-books-by-pratchett-terry-z-lib.org)
have better cover art on them. And you can just download them and you're done.
So pay+donate for the books, and ignore what you bought completely. Download them for free 
off of archive.org instead.

Author God Michael Warren Lucas [blogged about this too](https://mwl.io/archives/23343).

## Kindle-pocolypse: Feb 26 2025

Feb 14 2025. I saw toots about Amazon removing "Download & Transfer via USB"
[on Feb 26](https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/amazon-removing-download-and-transfer-on-the-kindle-feb-26th).
For 14 years I bought books from them, and now they're removing the last emergency
escape hatch for "my books" that "I own?" I had paid full retail price for every
one of them, even when Kindle prices were higher than paperback, which always
shocked me. But I loved the convenience of Kindle, so I paid.

I had never used "Download & Transfer via USB" before.
I had never tried to read any of my Kindle books
anywhere but the latest Amazon software, or on a series of devices I purchased from Amazon
at full retail price.
I had heard rumors of De-DRMing Kindle books, but had never looked into it.

This announcement felt like a violation of the peace agreement I had with Amazon.
I can't trust them. I must escape with my library before it's too late.

Thanks to [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) and the 
[DeDRM](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools) plugin I got out. All my books are now `.epub`
files. Or whatever other format I tell Calibre to convert them to, whenever, for whatever
reason.

Over on YouTube, Rachel does a great job showing you how. I don't have a Kobo (yet?),
but regardless, you need to de-DRM (or *at least download*) your Kindle purchases **before Feb 26**.
Once your books are DRM-free in Calibre you have all
the options and time in the world to decide whatever you want to do later:

## My new relationship with eBook DRM

So instead of forever pumping money at Amazon, I think this is my new set of goals
for the books I read:

* I choose to pay (or not) whatever price authors want to set on their work.
  Authors keep the vast majority of the money. Reasonable tech surcharges are fine,
  as decided by the author.
* Authors have the freedom to choose whatever publication vectors they want.
* My Dropbox has my library in it, DRM-free, so I have options when I want to re-read
  something I bought decades ago, or when my eReader breaks.
  I don't trust any company to still exist, or have not turned evil, a month from now.

So in practice that means:

* Calibre (Dropbox) is my eBook library. All DRM-free.
* When I buy a book, I'll be hoping it can be purchased DRM free. If it can't, then
  I'll buy it wherever the author prefers or send money directly to the author, and
  then de-DRM/pirate the book for my library.
* I'll use whatever eReader, since now I'm "side-loading" everything I purchase
  onto the device if that store doesn't sell DRM-free versions.

## Misc

* 2023-12-08 Cory Doctorow: ["If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing."](https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/#tyler-james-hill)

* My friends who have had all their music, books, and movies on their own hard drives for years
laugh at me for being so late to the game. They tried to warn me decades ago.
I am young, foolish, naive.

* Meanwhile, my 4K songs I've purchased since high school are still in the Apple cloud,
for which I'm still paying $25/year.
[iTunes Match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Match#iTunes_Match)
isn't cool anymore, they want everyone in "Apple Music" nowadays.
I guess... I should stop buying music in iTunes store and jailbreak my library?
But I'm so lazy, and clouds are so convenient. That'll be another blog entry someday?

## My local library, eReaders

I want my eReader lit for night reading, with physical page turn buttons.
I don't care about color or stylus,
I use my iPad + Apple Pencil for comics / taking notes / drawing.

* Omaha Public Library [supports OverDrive and Libby](https://omahalibrary.org/ebooks-downloads/)
borrowing, and magazines, audio books, etc., etc.
* $150 [NOOK GlowLight 4](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nook-glowlight-4-barnes-noble/1145507276). Lit, buttons, B&W. Ugh: You have to go through Adobe Digital Editions (ADE)
on a separate computer to use Libby?
* $230 [Rakuten Kobo Libra Colour](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-colour). Lit, buttons, color. $70 more for a stylus.
"Borrow eBooks directly from your local library with OverDrive and Libby integration‚Å∂."
* $580 [reMarkable Paper Pro](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-paper/pro) is super
fancy, but I already have an iPad for super fancy. I enjoy e-Ink for reading, not for trying
to compete with my OLED iPad + Apple Pencil.

eReaders I own:
* [Rakuten Kobo Libra Colour](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-colour) (2025)
* v5.16.2.1.1 Kindle Paperwhite 7th gen (2015) - my brother's, abandoned. Working great.
* v4.1.4 Kindle 4th gen (2011) - battery is bricked.
* v3.4.3 Kindle Keyboard 3rd gen (2010) - Steve's, abandoned. Battery super short.
* [Kindle end-of-life](https://endoflife.date/kindle) dates.

## What I'm currently reading, recommendations

* [Me on BookWyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/deafferret). Federate all the things! Slick!
  * To Read: [Apocalypse Moi](https://bookwyrm.social/book/1890499/s/apocalypse-moi). Neat, it let me
  add an image, description, and link to his store.
  * Doesn't track daily "% read" stat. Bummer.
* [Me on StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/deafferret)
  * I apparently can't write a blurb there (e.g. who recommended) until after I flag the book as owned?
  * To-Read: [Apocalypse Moi](https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com/product/apocalypse-moi/), whose ISBN StoryGraph refuses to load?
  * Ugh. But don't buy eBooks here, apparently:
    **Q:** Can I read my ebooks on my Kindle, Kobo, Nook, etc.?
    **A:** Ebooks from Bookshop.org **must be read on either our Apple or Android app**...
  * Does track daily "% read" stat, set your own daily goal, tracks streaks. Neat!

    I ditched Goodreads (now owned by Amazon) four years ago and never once looked back. 
    I really like [StoryGraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/) - it's simple, clean and refreshingly clutter-free.

Attempts to buy EPUBs:

* I used the Contact form on
  [North Omaha History Bookstore](https://northomahahistory.com/north-omaha-history-bookstore/)
  to see if Adam wants to sell me EPUB files of his books.

You can select a local bookstore to support with your purchases and they are
[DRM-free](https://blog.libro.fm/cage-free-audiobooks/).
I do have a [referral link](https://libro.fm/referral?rf_code=lfm506344) if you end up wanting to join :)
