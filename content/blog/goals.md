For my current goals see my [resume](/blog/resume) and [motivators](/blog/motivators)
I guess?

## circa 2000 (exact date unknown)

I have to admit I'm feeling more fulfilled now than I have been
since my early college days. For me happiness lies in feeling that
I'm getting the chance to prove myself in the areas I have skills in.
Since I've spent the last 5+ years in the Information Technology
business, my current top-priority life challenge is to prove to myself
(and to anyone else who cares to watch) that
I'm more than just a "wiz-kid" at a few computer gizmos
here or there; that I have real leadership potential and can effectively
organize and maintain a scope of technical resource beyond my own
meager 40-60 hours of weekly manpower.

If I can thrive in this environment for 3-5 years it's off to some
suit-and-tie VP position on my way to retiring as CIO somewhere.
Things are looking pretty good. Wish me luck.
