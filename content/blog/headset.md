8.5 years ago humanity made perfect headphones: MPOW Jaws:

* wired, around neck so I don't lose em.
* they don't fall off fat necks ðŸ‡º
* great audio, mic quality
* great battery life (18 hours of play time?), fast charging
* physical power switch (instant on/off!)
* physical FF/REW buttons
* physical volume up/down buttons
* $20

For 8.5 years I used those damn things for hours every day. Best money I ever spent.

Unfortunately, MPOW Jaws Gen 5 eliminated all the buttons except 3. Now FF/REW
takes longer. Power on/off takes a lot longer. $30.

AFAICT, these generic rip-offs of MPOW Jaws are the best headphones made today,
worse than they used to be, but functional: Amazon doesn't sell the MPOW
originals anymore? (Or maybe MPOW was never the original, maybe those were
ripoffs too?) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JYJ6JKH

I am jealous that AirPods merge left + right channels into a single channel if
only using one. That is cool. My $30 headphones donâ€™t do that. ðŸ™‚
