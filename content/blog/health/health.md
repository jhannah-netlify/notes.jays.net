## 2025-08 (bacterial sinus infection?)

### Aug 6

Normal 6-month dental cleaning, w/ x-rays. No problems, x-rays look good.

### Aug 10-14

[Scuba diving](../scuba/) in the Cayman Islands I got a few headaches at depth. 
Not unprecedented. 10 years ago my ENT doctor told me for deep diving:

1. Double my 20' safety stops (3 -> 6 minutes)
2. Use Oxymetazoline HCI 0.05% over-the-counter nasal spray before first deep dive.

And that worked fine for ~10 years. Not so much on this trip. Bummer.

I switched regulators, skipped a few deep dives, various things seemed to work, then didn't?
Quite mysterious. Do I have a sinus infection but I can't tell?
Zero symptoms above water.

### Tue Aug 26 - Thu Aug 28 (day 1-3)

Back home. Whoah. Weird. Headache. Ear pressure. Sinus pressure.
All symptoms on right side of head.
Some mild tooth pain.
Everything fine for ~6 hour blocks sometimes, then I got hit by a truck of sinus-style pain.
Sleep difficult, sometimes only possible on one or the other side.
I'll see how I feel in the morning. If whatever this is isn't gone, it's doctor time
tomorrow.

### Fri Aug 29 (day 4)

Ya, I don't feel good. Definitely need to see a doctor before the long weekend starts.
Got my ass kicked in one morning meeting. 15 minutes later I feel totally fine, like nothing
was ever wrong with me.

11am: Priority Care doctor is surprised that he's not seeing obvious sinus infection in his examination. My blood pressure and everything else are normal. Prescribes:
* fluticasone propionate 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray. 2 sprays each nostril, once daily.
* oxymetazoline 0.05% nasal spray. The same stuff as my scuba diving.
  _Use no more than 3 days to avoid rebound congestion._
* amoxicillin-clavulanate 875-125 mg tablet. 1 tablet twice daily for 7 days.

Notes:

* The sprays are for generally fighting sinus. Yes, do the netti-pot, that's always
  good for sinuses.
* The tablet is for fighting bacterial infection. But they don't recommend starting
  that until day 10.
* If viral infection they don't do anything about it. If viral, it should clear by day 3-7.

### Sat Aug 30 (day 5)

2am: oh no. So much tooth pain! Impossible to sleep. Suddenly I've gone from "sinus infection?"
to "holy shit I'm in a dental emergency?"

6am: Reached out to my normal dentist in emergency mode. He calls me back an hour
later. I tell him the whole story, he reviews a bunch of stuff, tells me without a
physical trauma it's almost impossible I've developed a cavity or other structural
problem that quickly after my set of x-rays less than a month ago.

Dentist recommends starting my amox tablet prescription *immediately*, because that's
the same prescription he would have called in for me this morning.
Says in 1-2 tablets it should knock out any bacterial thing I've got going on.

9am: amoxicillin-clavulanate 875-125 mg tablet #1

9pm: amoxicillin-clavulanate 875-125 mg tablet #2

### Sun Aug 31 (day 6)

3am: I think those tablets are indeed, my salvation. Crazy to me
that the first advice was to wait until day 10 when it's a miracle drug in my case?
Slept a bunch yesterday, netti-potted, ibuprofen for pain, but generally feeling like
we've whipped this problem and I'm well on my way back to normal.

9am: amoxicillin-clavulanate 875-125 mg tablet #3

4pm: All my other symptoms are gone. Now it's only lower right tooth pain,
"managed" with maximum doctor-allowed Ibuprofen: 3,200 mg / 24 hours.

covid-19 test: negative.

8pm: amoxicillin-clavulanate 875-125 mg tablet #4

11pm: Very desperate against chronic pain, mental / emotional health completely
shot (pain + lack of / poor sleep).
Trying ice packs for the first time. The pain of the ice pack seems to replace
the tooth pain, and when the ice pain fades I have some tooth pain relief...
for an hour or so?

### Mon Sep 1 (day 7)

4am: Feeling OK right now, got 3(?) hours of interrupted sleep since 11pm.

5am: 2 Ibuprofen = 400 mg (400/3200 total for today)

7:30 am: amoxicillin-clavulanate 875-125 mg tablet #5<br/>
2 Ibuprofen = 400 mg (800/3200 total for today)

11:30 am: 2 Ibuprofen = 400 mg (1200/3200 total for today)

7:30 pm: amoxicillin-clavulanate 875-125 mg tablet #6


## Epilogue
Doctor says everything is going to be OK. Chase squirrels, lots of naps, snacks.
