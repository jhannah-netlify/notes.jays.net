*Dad wrote this to me. It's very sweet. He's a great father. --Jay* 🙂❤️

Author Christian Picciolini suggests that there are three things every human
most essentially needs: a wholesome sense of identity, a caring community, and
a meaningful life purpose.

The following is Jay Hannah’s **ICP**, viewed from his dad’s perspective:

### IDENTITY

Jay is a manifestation of the energy of compassion, expressed in both empathy
and action, as evidenced by the caring he exhibits in long-term leadership and
support of Food Not Bombs; assistance for Scottie and other persons in need;
kindness to Huey and animals in general; and a host of philanthropic donations
to not-for-profits, from housing to micro loans, etc. Typically, when we were
with Jay this past week he stoped to give money to a woman selling candy
outside the Asian Market. To me, this is more than just what Jay does, it’s
also who Jay is. 

### COMMUNITY

Jay has a wide web of relationships, ranging from S and Z; to his
nuclear family (parents, brother, uncles, cousins, etc.); to neighbors (C,
B, “the other” Jay & S,” etc.); to Food Not Bombs volunteers and
recipients; to computer nerds and his poker gang; to scuba divers and
international friends; to on-line friends, etc. 

### PURPOSE

Jay values being a contributive member of society and seeks to make the world a
better place for all. He has held steady employment for 30 years, pays taxes
for the common good, is an informed citizen and voter, and is generous to
individuals in need and to organizations dedicated to humanitarian and
environmental causes. 

Jay has exceptional computer and problem-solving aptitudes and interests,
coupled with other attributes that made him a valuable team member: socially
adept, a good listener, emotionally mature, a creative thinker, a giver rather
than a taker, and a Mensa-level IQ (intellectual quotient) as well as EQ
(emotional quotient).

One of my main yearnings for Jay’s life is expressed in a Robert Frost poem,
“Two Tramps in Mud Time” (noting that his reference to Heaven is, for me,
here-and-now, not hereafter):

> But yield who will to their separation,  
> My object in living is to unite  
> My avocation and my vocation  
> As my two eyes make one in sight.  
> Only where love and need are one,  
> And the work is play for mortal stakes,  
> Is the deed ever really done  
> For Heaven and the future’s sake.   

*For the record, I know MENSA folks. I have not taken their tests, nor do I think
I would score high enough if I did w/o extensive test prep. --Jay* 😉
