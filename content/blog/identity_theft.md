Horror story, but apparently it's true.

I'm sitting in an AWS meetup, and a dude is telling a story about how 50 people
physically showed up on a Tuesday at his wife's Fortune 500 company.

All 50 people said that they start their new job today. She works in HR, she
has 0 new employees starting today.

Apparently scammers had completely mirrored the company's career website,
conducted interviews with these candidates, sent them written offer letters,
had them fill out I-9 forms to start their new jobs... An insane phishing
attack where the scammers have gathered everything there is to know about these
50 people, including banking information "for credit checks," social security
numbers, everything you hand over to a new employer to accept a job offer.

Obviously, devastating for these 50 people. Not only has their TOTAL identity
been stolen, they're still unemployed.

Twitter.))
