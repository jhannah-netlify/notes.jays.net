I now have 67 episodes in my feed, back to 2015.

I host my podcast two different ways:

1. [via GitHub Pages + AWS S3](https://jhannah.github.io/jayflaunts). Costs me pennies a month.
1. [via Castopod](https://jayflaunts.podcast.audio/@JayFlaunts). Fancier ("podcasting 2.0!"), costs $8/month or something. I pay them to host that feed.

Why do I hve two feeds? Because I'm a huge fan of
[Mastodon](/blog/mastodon/)
and the promise of "the Fediverse is more than just Mastodon!"
So I launched up on Castopod too.
[But it's not yet everything I hoped it would be?](/blog/castopod/)
