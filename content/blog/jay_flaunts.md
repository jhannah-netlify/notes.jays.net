I now have 67 episodes in my feed, back to 2015.

I host my podcast two different ways:

1. [via GitHub Pages + AWS S3](https://jhannah.github.io/jayflaunts). Costs me pennies a month.
1. [via Castopod](https://jayflaunts.podcast.audio/@JayFlaunts). Fancier ("podcasting 2.0!"), costs $8/month or something. I pay them to host that feed.

Why do I have two feeds? Because I'm a huge fan of
[Mastodon](/blog/mastodon/)
and the promise of "the Fediverse is more than just Mastodon!"
So I launched up on Castopod too.
[But it's not yet everything I hoped it would be?](/blog/castopod/)

I also use [a tiny OpenAI Whisper script](https://github.com/jhannah/sandbox/blob/main/OpenAI/whisper.py)
to kick out transcripts and copy/paste those into the show notes (GitHub).
I find the errors very entertaining.
Way better than typing it all out manually.
It wouldn't be so bad to clean up that output. I haven't bothered.

I'm sure better transcript services are available.
Some of them identify multiple speakers and label them! Wowzers!

And Apple Podcasts.app has *excellent* transcripts generated automatically,
but you can only see those from inside their apps.

I'm not aware of any transcript services that work as well as OpenAI
Whisper does for the pennies those transcripts cost me.
(On top of the $20/month I throw at OpenAI.)

I also pay [s3stat.com](https://www.s3stat.com) $10/month to parse my S3
logs, because I've been too lazy to automate that myself.
And they have pretty graphs.
([Castopod](/blog/castopod/) has pretty graphs of downloads and other metrics
built in for free.)

## Shorts ideas

* Grandpa bought Zach "donuts".
* The house was full of food, "there's nothing to eat."
* Land acknowledgements. 1st Sky Omaha vs...
