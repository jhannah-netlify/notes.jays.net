I live [here](https://flyovercountry.social/@deafferret) on Mastodon.

## Mastodon vs. Bluesky, etc.

You do you. People like different things. I got sick of Nazis on Twitter in 
2017, so I left<sup>[1]</sup>. Some of my friends prefer Bluesky. 
Here's a little grid of the features I care about:

|                          | Mastodon | Bluesky |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------- |
| Clean feed of follows    | ✅ | ✅ |
| Alt text for images      | ✅ | ✅ |
| Post editing             | ✅ | ❌ |
| Content warnings         | ✅ | ❌ |
| I can pick my moderators | ✅ | ❌ |
| Migrate elsewhere        | ✅ | ❌ |

If the main thing you care about is discoverability, then Mastodon can
be a pain in the butt. I don't care about that. There are thousands of
fascinating people on Mastodon, that's enough for me. Way more than I
could ever read.
I give zero shits about following celebrities / mass market accounts.

*Footnotes:*

[1] I never actually delete my account anywhere. Because I always have
a specific cousin who only uses FaceBook, a specific friend that only
uses Twitter, I get fired so need LinkedIn again, etc.
I just ignore those networks completely until I *need* them.
At which point I log in once, do the thing, and leave.
If my account existing gives Musk a $65B bonus, so be it. (Oops.)

## Who I follow

(Originally from 2022.)

Not that anyone does or should care about any of this, but I'm
hyper-self-analytical, so here's me trying to write this down so I understand
my goals inside my own brain:

I enjoy my Home timeline as a diverse cross-section of people all over the
world with extremely varied interests. I'm fascinated by artists and how their
minds work. Also niche technologists, scientists, philosophers, psychologists,
podcasters, and political scientists trying to think deeply about trying to
solve problems.

I have zero interest in my Home timeline being a firehose of breaking news or
political shitshows. I use other vectors for those purposes. So if you post
non-personal politics without a CW I (probably) don't follow you.

Please DO rage against injustice you are personally experiencing, with or
without a CW (your choice). If shit is happening to YOU I want to support you
and know what's going on. I would love to know how to help, if there is some
way I can help.

If, on average, you post 15+ times a day I don't follow you. I might love you
to death and check in every once in a while, but you're drowning out the other
(~200, apparently) people I'm trying to follow.

Again, I don't recommend giving a shit whether I follow you or not. But this
helps me understand how my mind is working(?), so this post is helpful to me?
Maybe?

Be safe out there, friends. Be kind to one another, if you can.
