I live [here](https://flyovercountry.social/@deafferret) on Mastodon.

You do you. People like different things. I got sick of Nazis on Twitter in 
2017, so I left<sup>[1]</sup>. Some of my friends prefer Bluesky. 
Here's a little grid of the features I care about:

|                          | Mastodon | Bluesky |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------- |
| Clean feed of follows    | ✅ | ✅ |
| Alt text for images      | ✅ | ✅ |
| Post editing             | ✅ | ❌ |
| Content warnings         | ✅ | ❌ |
| I can pick my moderators | ✅ | ❌ |
| Migrate elsewhere        | ✅ | ❌ |

If the main thing you care about is discoverability, then Mastodon can
be a pain in the butt. I don't care about that. There are thousands of
fascinating people on Mastodon, that's enough for me. Way more than I
could ever read.
I give zero shits about following celebrities / mass market accounts.

*Footnotes:*

[1] I never actually delete my account anywhere. Because I always have
a specific cousin who only uses FaceBook, a specific friend that only
uses Twitter, I get fired so need LinkedIn again, etc.
I just ignore those networks completely until I *need* them.
At which point I log in once, do the thing, and leave.
If my account existing gives Musk a $65B bonus, so be it. (Oops.)
