You'll find me [here on Mastodon](https://flyovercountry.social/@deafferret),
micro-blogging ~daily. I love it.

## Mastodon vs. Bluesky, etc.

You do you. People like different things. I got sick of Nazis on Twitter in 
2017, so I left<sup>[1]</sup>. Some of my friends prefer Bluesky. 
Here's a little grid of the features I care about:

|                            | Mastodon | Bluesky |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Clean feed of follows      | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Alt text for images        | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Edit posts                 | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Content warnings           | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Hide boosts from a follow  | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Pick your moderators       | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Migrate elsewhere          | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Discoverability            | üü° | ‚úÖ |

If the main thing you care about is discoverability, then Mastodon can
be a pain in the butt. I don't care about that. There are thousands of
fascinating people on Mastodon, that's enough for me. Way more than I
could ever read.
I give zero shits about following celebrities / mass market accounts.

Less important to me, but very cool things Bluesky does that Mastodon doesn't:

* Domain handles are slick!
  e.g. I'm [@jays.net](https://bsky.app/profile/jays.net) on Bluesky.
* Starter Packs are neat!
  e.g. [OMA/LNK Tech & Tech-Adjacent](https://bsky.app/starter-pack-short/LYPECZh).
  Great way to on-board communities. The Mastodon versions of this are less good?:
  * Running an instance is ... a lot.
  * Lists can't be shared publicly?

*Footnotes:*

**[1]** I never actually delete my account anywhere. Because I always have
a specific cousin who only uses FaceBook, a specific friend that only
uses Twitter, I get fired so need LinkedIn again, etc.
I just ignore those networks completely until I *need* them.
At which point I log in once, do the thing, and leave.
If my account existing gives Musk a $65B bonus, so be it. (Oops.)

## Who I follow

(Originally from 2022.)

Not that anyone does or should care about any of this, but I'm
hyper-self-analytical, so here's me trying to write this down so I understand
my goals inside my own brain:

I enjoy my Home timeline as a diverse cross-section of people all over the
world with extremely varied interests. I'm fascinated by artists and how their
minds work. Also niche technologists, scientists, philosophers, psychologists,
podcasters, and political scientists trying to think deeply about trying to
solve problems.

I have zero interest in my Home timeline being a firehose of breaking news or
political shitshows. I use other vectors for those purposes. So if you post
non-personal politics without a CW I (probably) don't follow you.

Please DO rage against injustice you are personally experiencing, with or
without a CW (your choice). If shit is happening to YOU I want to support you
and know what's going on. I would love to know how to help, if there is some
way I can help.

If, on average, you post 15+ times a day I don't follow you. I might love you
to death and check in every once in a while, but you're drowning out the other
(~350, apparently) people I'm trying to follow.

Again, I don't recommend giving a shit whether I follow you or not. But this
helps me understand how my mind is working(?), so this post is helpful to me?
Maybe?

Be safe out there, friends. Be kind to one another, if you can.

## Q&A

Cleo [asked research questions](https://eldritch.cafe/@toplesstopics/113856397652645027):

**Q: What was the final straw that finally got you to make an account here?**

I was a semi-early adopter of Twitter. It was good, fun, for years.
In 2017 I couldn't put up with their timeline fuckery anymore.
I just wanted a clean list of tweets from the people I chose to follow.

And assholes kept leeching into my Twitter experience via replies on my follows' tweets.
I couldn't block them all, the space felt more and more hostile.

And Twitter kept sending me notifications I didn't want or opt into.

**Q: Did it take you a while to figure out how the fediverse works, or did you take to it right away?**

Federation is complicated, it takes a while to wrap your head around.
If you join a big server you might find life easier as a beginner?
It didn't seem too hard to me, but it is/was buggy, frustrating sometimes.
Presumably, lots of people just want it to work, have no interest in how.

I'm a weirdo ("engineer") who enjoys understanding how things work.

**Q: Do you still use mainstream social media? How often do you post there vs here?**

I might check in on other social networks once every month or two to check
on specific people. I almost never post on them.
See Footnote [1] above.

**Q: What is your level of tech expertise? Were/are you already a tech expert?**

Decades of computer programming.
