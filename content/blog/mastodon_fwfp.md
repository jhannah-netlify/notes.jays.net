Hello there. My name is [Jay Hannah](https://flyovercountry.social/@deafferret).
Since 2021 I've been the volunteer that has been (with permission) manually re-posting
every [Flatwater Free Press (FWFP)](https://flatwaterfreepress.org/)
article onto Mastodon.

## FWFP posts directly on Bluesky 

On Jan 6, 2025
[FWFP announced](https://bsky.app/profile/flatwaterfreep.bsky.social/post/3lf3zssfzgk2i)
that they were leaving Twitter, officially moving to Bluesky. Unfortunately,
their systems don't also post directly to Mastodon. So I'm not obsolete yet?

So if you're on Bluesky, please [follow FWFP there](https://bsky.app/profile/flatwaterfreep.bsky.social).

## FWFP posts bridge from Bluesky into Mastodon

On May 30, 2025 we started an experiment. Thanks to `brid.gy` there's now a
Mastodon "account" that you can follow. When you do, every *new* post by FWFP
on Bluesky will show up in your Mastodon home feed.

So in your Mastodon client, please search for, and then follow
`@flatwaterfreep.bsky.social@bsky.brid.gy`. (We can't web link you there since
the bridge accounts aren't like regular accounts that have globally accessible 
landing pages.)

(Trust me. It looks weird (not like normal accounts), but it works. Follow that
account and then wait a couple days, you'll see new toots coming through 
even though it looks like toot history is empty / the account is broken before
you follow it.)

## I continue to manually post to Mastodon

Most days I sweep the "[All our stores](https://flatwaterfreepress.org/all-our-stories/)" page and manually posts any new articles into Mastodon.
You can follow that human-driven account here:
[@flatwaterfreepress@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@flatwaterfreepress)

From that account, nowadays, as long as the `brid.gy` bridge keeps working,
I'm likely to Boost the `brid.gy` toot of those new articles instead of manually
creating a fresh toot.

Why am I still involved in any of this?
Well, it seems advantages and disadvantages are afoot:

* `@flatwaterfreep.bsky.social@bsky.brid.gy` (automatic via Bluesky)
  * real-time feed from Bluesky (critical for breaking news)
  * some articles are tooted multiple times
  * FWFP sometimes toots things other than new articles
  * will go silent whenever `brid.gy` fails
  * toots don't have their own pages in which you can see threads of replies (it's rare that people reply to posts. I have yet to see a thread of multiple replies.)
  * your local server may have blocked `bsky.brid.gy` because they don't want to host bot data in their server cache
* [`@flatwaterfreepress@mastodon.social`](https://mastodon.social/@flatwaterfreepress) (me, manually)
  * is only updated once ~daily
  * toots articles that were never posted on Bluesky
  * single toot per article
  * I may or may not toot / boost things that aren't new articles. I figure if you wanted **all** of those you would have followed the bridge account?
  * toots have normal threads where people can reply / discuss articles amongst themselves as much as they like
  * "All our stories" is sometimes delayed until an article is pulled from the FWFP homepage, so some articles apparently won't appear until days after publication. Unless they're re-tooted from the bridge.
  * will go silent whenever I have a stroke, or am out of the country (infrequent)
  * your local server may have blocked `mastodon.social` because your local admin thinks that server does a terrible job moderating that community

When could I retire? When...
* FWFP starts posting all their articles into Bluesky.
  e.g.: I'm not sure why they, so far, aren't posting their
  [Documenters](https://flatwaterfreepress.org/documenters/) articles.
* When the vast majority of people are following the `brid.gy` account and are happy
  with how it works (e.g.: no reply threads is fine).
* When we're comfortable `brid.gy` is stable and going to stay online (for free),
  "indefinitely."
* When FWFP starts posting to Mastodon directly.
* ?

I'm extremely open to feedback about this page, these strategies, etc.
Please [toot at me](https://flyovercountry.social/@deafferret).

Oh, and please [donate to FWFP](https://flatwaterfreepress.org/donate/)
if you can. We need more local, ad free, paywall free journalism.
Thanks!
