Notes Jay tried to take:

* Nebraska has sub-standard tenants rights for all other renters. 
* [Legal Aid of Nebraska](https://www.legalaidofnebraska.org/)
* [Omaha Housing Authority](https://ohauthority.org/) (OHA) suing:
  Sep 16th 2025 at first hearing OHA did not bring any lawyers specific to convictions. Suing state and not a legal SME. They have to sue the SME not the state.
  * [The Redress Movement - Omaha](https://redressmovement.org/omaha/): Clarice Dombeck says OHA lawsuit is not going well for OHA.
