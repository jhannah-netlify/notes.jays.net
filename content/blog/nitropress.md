## Wait, what now?

My friend said "I've got this great gadget in my kitchen. I just push a button and drinks
(e.g. coffee cold brew) are injected with nitrogen. Just like Guiness.
No gas canisters required!"

I'm sure it is delicious, but since I'm a nitrox certified scuba diver,
and I've seen all the **massive, expensive, loud, time consuming** equipment that goes into making
special gas mixtures for deep / repetitious scuba diving... how could any countertop
device possibly filter air into ~pure nitrogen in seconds? At any price?

Apparently the answer is: "it doesn't." 

It's just injecting air. Which is fine? Air is 78% nitrogen anyway. So they're not
lying. They're mostly adding nitrogen. And so are you, every time you inhale.

I Google'd (Kagi'd) around for the specs, science, eventually gave up and threw
the question out to ChatGPT 4o, which spewed forth the following:

> CO2, and oxygen is in the result?*

## üå¨Ô∏è NitroPress DS ‚Äì Gas Composition After Filtration

The **NitroPress DS** is a countertop device designed to infuse beverages with nitrogen, creating a smooth, creamy texture similar to nitro cold brew coffee.

Unlike traditional systems that use disposable nitrogen cartridges, the NitroPress DS extracts nitrogen directly from **ambient air** and passes it through a **200-micron filter**.

### üß™ Ambient Air Composition (After 200-Micron Filter)

| Gas              | Approximate % |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Nitrogen (N‚ÇÇ)** | ~78%           |
| **Oxygen (O‚ÇÇ)**   | ~21%           |
| **Carbon Dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ)** | ~0.04%    |
| **Other Gases**   | ~1% (argon, neon, etc.) |

**Note:** The 200-micron filter only removes **particulates**, not gases ‚Äî so the composition remains the same as ambient air.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations

- **Nitrogen Purity**: Because the system uses air, nitrogen is **not as pure** as from
cartridges. This may result in a **milder nitro effect**.

- **Oxygen Presence**: Oxygen is still present in the gas mix, which can **accelerate
oxidation** in some beverages.

- **Taste and Texture**: While the NitroPress DS does create a smooth texture, results
may differ slightly from pure nitrogen infusion systems.

Video demo: [Nitro Cold Brew from thin air! | NitroPress DS](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DxWr9GZV_gc&t=3m4s) -- dude compares original Nitropress (using ~100% nitrogen single-use canisters) vs Nitropress DS (air (78% nitrogen)).

*[ Unless you're living at extreme altitude, your air is not "thin." --Jay ]*

**Jay's Conclusion:** I'm sure it's great, and not having to pay for single-use canisters must
save a ton of money assuming you use it a bunch.

This made me think of the
[Triton 'Tankless' Scuba Mask](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/triton-scuba-mask-design/)
scam of 2013. Tiny tech that's somehow converting the molecular composition of
water / air rapidly?

Nitropress is just for drinks, harmless, I wouldn't say they're lying. The marketing is just
confusing to gas nerds like me. 

When Triton lied about scuba tech people could die (drown).
