Someone, who I assume is younger than me (aren't you all),
was complaining about a shitty bank loan and their ancient website sucking for
auto-draft management.

"Why autodraft?" I asked. Just autopay from your not-shitty bank where your
money is.

"They don't have the routing / account numbers stuff."

"? Just have your bank mail them a check every month then."

"You can do that?!? â€¦ It works! You're a goddamn genius!"

Nah. I'm just so old that when they added that feature 20 years ago it was
exciting and new and now I expect it to exist. 

As opposed to people who weren't mailing checks via USPS in the late 20th
century so all of this makes no sense as an expectation.

I have ancient steam-punk magics lodged in my old brain.
