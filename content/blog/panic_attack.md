## At work

2007. I had been working for a hotel company for 7 years. 

I arrived at work. I got in the elevator.
The doors closed and I had a (small?<sup>[1]</sup>) panic attack.

The next day I tried to quit.
And they wouldn't let me quit, so I ended up working remotely from the med center ~pursuing a bioinformatics BS part time while still working for them remotely 30 hours a week.
I don't think I've talked publicly about which of my several bosses at the time was actively destroying my physical / mental health. 

I think that's the only (work) time my body has physically rejected what my brain thought my goals were.

(1) panic attack
(2) talk to wife
(3) I quit
(4) what if we break all our unbreakable rules (remote not allowed, etc.) so you keep working for us, "part time"?
(5) oh?! great! let's do that!

## Scuba diving

I also had (small?<sup>[1]</sup>) panic attacks while learning to scuba dive.
