**Apr 2025 update:** Wrapped up an awesome 6-month bioinformatics Python ->
Terraform -> AWS gig. Open to new telecommute Python / Golang / Perl
software stacks, database thrashing / analytics, or DevOps / cloud
infrastructure work.

**aka:** Seeking challenging technical leadership opportunity
managing large scale data systems. Diagram, TDD, and CI/CD addict. Love
untangling epic git disasters. Perl / Python / Golang / DBs / APIs / cloud.

A couple years ago, in a fit of hubris and optimism, I decided to add a
"Dream Job" section:

**Dream Job:** Using my backend / database / programming skills to help with
massively scaled providers of emergency / low-income housing and food. The
UNHCR (High Council on Refugees) and WFP (World Food Program) are the largest
examples of that mission I'm aware of. I'm very interested in logistics. The
highest calling I can imagine is working on empowering thousands / millions of
deliveries of food / clothing / shelter.

## Nerd versions

Wouldn't it be nice if the hiring landscape was driven by open standards data instead of
warring walled gardens that keep getting worse / more expensive? That would be
*so much better* for candidates **and** companies looking to hire?

My resume in JSON, which can be transformed into any format, is the dream?

For now, I also have a parallel source of truth:
