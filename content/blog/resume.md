Aug 2024 update: Woot! Started a new gig! Thanks, everyone, for all the help!

**When I'm on the hunt:** Seeking challenging technical leadership opportunity
managing large scale data systems. Diagram, TDD, and CI/CD addict. Love
untangling epic git disasters. Perl / Python / Golang / DBs / APIs / cloud.

A year ago, in a fit of hubris and optimism, I decided to add a "Dream Job" section
to my resume:

**Dream Job:** Using my backend / database / programming skills to help with
massively scaled providers of emergency / low-income housing and food. The
UNHCR (High Council on Refugees) and WFP (World Food Program) are the largest
examples of that mission I'm aware of. I'm very interested in logistics. The
highest calling I can imagine is working on empowering thousands / millions of
deliveries of food / clothing / shelter.
