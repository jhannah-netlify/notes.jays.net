**Jul 2025 update:** Started a new job building a data lakehouse in AWS.
S3 CSV / Parquet files loaded via (Python) Lambda Glue Jobs, Crawlers to query in Athena. 
CloudWatch Metrics, Alarms. EventBridge Rules, Targets.
All provisioned via Terraform.
Orchestrated via AWS Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA).
DBT feeding Redshift, Power BI data cubes.

One-liner résumé: ~~Seeking~~ telecommuting Python / Golang / Perl software stacks,
database thrashing / analytics, or DevOps / cloud infrastructure work.
Diagram, TDD, and CI/CD addict. Love untangling epic git disasters.

A couple years ago, in a fit of hubris and optimism, I decided to add a
"Dream Job" section:

**Dream Job:** Using my backend / database / programming skills to help with
massively scaled providers of emergency / low-income housing and food. The
UNHCR (High Council on Refugees) and WFP (World Food Program) are the largest
examples of that mission I'm aware of. I'm very interested in logistics. The
highest calling I can imagine is working on empowering thousands / millions of
deliveries of food / clothing / shelter.

## Nerd versions

Wouldn't it be nice if the hiring landscape was driven by open standards data instead of
warring walled gardens that keep getting worse / more expensive? That would be
*so much better* for candidates **and** companies looking to hire?

My resume in JSON, which can be transformed into any format, is the dream?

For now, I also have a parallel source of truth:
