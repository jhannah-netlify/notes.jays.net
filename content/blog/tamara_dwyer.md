(Draft for discussion among Food Not Bombs, Omaha Nebraska USA volunteers.)

To:
* Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert<br/>
* Tamara Dwyer, Homeless Services Coordinator, City of Omaha Mayorâ€™s Office

We are writing in support of Tamara Dwyer, regarding
[comments made by mayoral candidate Mike McDonnell](https://www.wowt.com/2025/02/20/omaha-mayoral-candidate-calls-citys-homeless-coordinator-dei-hire-mayor-responds/).

We have met with Ms. Dwyer twice regarding the work that we do in Omaha,
and the work that she does. Ms. Dwyer is providing life-saving services to our
friends and neighbors in Omaha who most need our support. 

We are sad and angry about Mike McDonnell's comments, and hope that he some day
comes to understand that Omaha is a stronger community when we care for our neighbors.
All people in Omaha, regardless of their current housing status, deserve our care, respect,
and support when they need it most.

To Ms. Dwyer and her team: Thank you for all you've done, and continue to do.
People like you are living full lives of service to our most vulnerable, and
deserve our admiration, respect, and full support: financial, organizational, and
administrative. At all levels of government.

In solidarity,

Food Not Bombs<br/>
Omaha, Nebraska USA<br/>
