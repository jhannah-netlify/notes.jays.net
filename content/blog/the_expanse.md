Kenzo: It must be nice, having everything figured out like that.

Amos: Ain’t nothing to do with me: we’re just caught in the Churn, that’s all.

This boss I used to work for in Baltimore, he called it the Churn. When the rules of the game change.

What game?

The only game. Survival. When the jungle tears itself down and builds itself
into something new. Guys like you and me, we end up dead. Doesn’t really
mean anything. Or, if we happen to live through it, well that doesn’t mean anything either.
