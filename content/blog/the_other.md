First committed to version control
[in 2013](https://github.com/jhannah/jays.net/commits/main/the_other.txt),
I'm fascinated when any group of people has a word that means "everyone else."
So I've been collecting them. Additions welcome.

* not academia: industry
* not Amish: English
* not Catholic: protestant
* no cryptocurrency:
  * normie (ignorant)
  * nocoiner (aware rejection)
* not a gun owner: sheeple
* not Jewish: gentile, goy
* not LGBTQI2S+: cishet / cisgender
* not military: civilian
* not Mormon: gentile
* not Muslim: infidel
* not Scientologist: SP (suppressive person)

From fiction:

* not Grisha: Otkazat'sya (Shadow & Bone)
* not a wizard: muggle (Harry Potter)
* not a witch: fain (Half Bad)

Close, but not quite *everyone* else:

* OTM: Other Than Mexican (US Border Patrol)
