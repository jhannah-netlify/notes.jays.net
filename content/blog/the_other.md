First committed to version control
[in 2013](https://github.com/jhannah/jays.net/commits/main/the_other.txt),
I'm fascinated when any group of people has a word that means "everyone else."
So I've been collecting them. Additions welcome.

```

                    nocoiner (aware rejection)

non-Amish:          English
non-Catholic:       protestant
non-gun-owner:      sheeple
non-Jewish:         gentile, goy
non-LGBTQI:         cisgender
non-military:       civilian
non-Mormon:         gentile
non-Muslim:         infidel
non-Scientologist:  SP (suppressive person)

From fiction:

non-witch:          fain (Half Bad)
```
