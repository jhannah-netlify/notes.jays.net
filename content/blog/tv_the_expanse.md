Ah, man was $58 literally yesterday! [US Blu-Ray $80](https://amzn.to/42mPo55)

## S1 E7

Kenzo: It must be nice, having everything figured out like that.

Amos: Ain’t nothing to do with me: we’re just caught in the Churn, that’s all.

I have no idea what you just said.

This boss I used to work for in Baltimore, he called it the Churn.
When the rules of the game change.

What game?

The only game. Survival. When the jungle tears itself down and builds itself
into something new. Guys like you and me, we end up dead. Doesn’t really
mean anything. Or, if we happen to live through it, well that doesn’t mean anything either.

## S2 E13

Naomi: I don’t ever remember a time when Earth, Mars and the Belt weren’t fighting.
The sides change sometimes. What we think we’re fighting for. Who we tell ourselves
are the good people. But it just seems we can’t ever stop fighting war after war
after war. It’s part of being human. An ugly part, but I don’t think it will ever
change. Technology certainly hasn’t changed it. Guns. Railguns. Nuclear bombs.
No weapon ever brings peace.

## S3 E4

Prax: Amos, they're manufacturing these things. Twisting humans into monsters on purpose.
How could you do that to another person?

Amos: I think you and I had very different childhoods.

## S4

On 2019-12-28 I tooted:
Ha! The Expanse Season 4 is amazing. And wraps up with Klaes Ashford doing 2
super powerful (floating baby! OMG!) artistic readings of the lyrics of Captain Kidd
that I know from the Kansas City pirate shanty band The Jolly Rogers, Googling of which
led me to this new to me podcast
[feed where he interviews the band](https://www.underthecrossbones.com/utc-188-the-jolly-rogers/).
Squeal!

## S5 E10

Amos: Making a choice to hold your ground to save your family. As far as last stands go,
that's the one I'd pick. He picked it too.

Naomi: I called him a brave idiot.

Amos: There's worse things to be.
